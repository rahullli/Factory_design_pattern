# Factory_design_pattern

1. Factory Design Pattern is used to create objects at runtime based on some condition .
2. In this example , I have created 3 classes `[ GoldCard , SilverCard , PlatinumCard ]` .
3. I have also created an abstract class which will contain the method name `setCreditLimit` .
4. I have created a Factory Class in which on the basis of CardType , I am return the object out of the 3 cards .
